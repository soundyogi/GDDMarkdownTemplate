# Game Overview

The Party - A collaborative survival game with procedural dungeon exploring elements.

## Game Concept

You and your friends control what's left of a cargo ship, lost in space after an intergalactic battle climax. 
Your damaged engines are only capable of sublight and the nearest civilized planet won't be reachable anytime soon.
Around you, only wreckage of what once been the elite fleets beloning to the most advanced civilizations of the space quandrant.
Oxygen, water and energy gets scarce as you try to survive and repair your ship in order to go home.
You'll need to board treaturous shipwrecks to collect resources and materials. 
Are there any other survivers? Are they friendly? And is it true indeed that in space nobody will hear you scream?

## Target Audience

Groups of friends who struggle to find time to play together.
Inovative async gaming features will allow friends and families to play together but at different times of day.
Multi-platform support will also maximise accessibility, such as most of the game being playable on mobile with or without internet access.
The idea is to create a game system allowing for an eternal LAN party feel.
