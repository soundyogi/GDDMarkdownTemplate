# Gameplay and Mechanics

## Gameplay

### Game Progression

Game progression is measured by the ability to travel further from the central "Sun" and the number of survived days. The battleground is divided by an infinite amount of "Levels" which are defined by the radius. Each new level is therefore a bigger ring, farther from the center.
As resources fade players are bound to travel to higher levels containing more challenging wreckages.
A typical progress tracker would display "Day 120, Sector 8" indicating that on day 120, the party has been as far as the 8th ring/level.

### Objectives

The main mission is simply to escape the battleground. In order to do that, the party must acquire the light travel technology by upgrading the Cargo ship.
Side missions include clues found on shipwrecks revealing the map or other ships.

## Mechanics

### Movement

Movement is point and click style.
Abilities can include teleporting.

### Objects

Objects are either hardcoded or randomly generated.
Wearables such as armors and weapons are craftable. 
Weapons are made out of a base + mods. Allowing for the same weapon type to have different abilities.

#### Tek / Object Augmentation - Skills / Effects

Objects (mostly wearables) have "slots" that can be filled by "tek objects".
Slots can be filled by special objects that add active/passive effects, skills can be combined with other tek effects.
The slot - tek object binding can be permanent or non-permanent.

Non-Permanent bindings can be removed and re-structured.
Permanent bindings have the chance of generating much stronger results - but it has a random element.

Tek can add boni aswell as mali.
Example: Heal Tek increases your HP, and adds passive regenration effect to armor. But lowers your attack dmg.

Tek Objects can gain XP when used and level up to create stronger combinations aswell as adding a grinding element.

#### Tek

- Increase HP 
- Elemental Effects (Fire, Ice,..) - Adds elem. effect on weapon. Adds absorb / protection on armor.
- Status Effect (Poison, Confusion,..)

### Actions

Ship sections are opened by activating door controls.
Abilities are activated using keyboard keys + clicking.

### Crafting

A crafting station allows to break an item into basic components or assemble one from them.
Crafting consumes energy and has random elements, so players have the possibility to consume any abountant resource to obtain a better version of the craft.

#### Talking

Talking to online players can be done through voice or chat or quick voice commands.
Talking to offline players can be done by right clicking their avatar and selecting "message", or by referring to them in chat.
Offline players will receive the message on their companion app.

### Combat

Combat is a real time group engagement.
It can be either offensive during exploration, or defensive if the Cargo is under attack.
Player characters have defensive and offensive capabilities based on their class, stats, and equipment. Some are passive, some are active. The combat mechanism should really look like any point and click combat such as LoL.

#### Defense

During Phase 2, bandits and scavengers can attack the Cargo to steal resources. Players must try and defend the ship.
For that, some players can stay at the ship during the phase. Players also have the ability to set up traps and automatic defense systems.

#### Offense

During ship exploration, the team may encounter survivors. Most of them can be hostile.
