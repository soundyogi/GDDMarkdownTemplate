# Gameplay

## Game Progression

Game progression is measured by the ability to travel further from the central "Sun" and the number of survived days. The battleground is divided by an infinite amount of "Levels" which are defined by the radius. Each new level is therefore a bigger ring, farther from the center.
As resources fade players are bound to travel to higher levels containing more challenging wreckages.
A typical progress tracker would display "Day 120, Sector 8" indicating that on day 120, the party has been as far as the 8th ring/level.

## Objectives

The main mission is simply to escape the battleground. In order to do that, the party must acquire the light travel technology by upgrading the Cargo ship.
Side missions include clues found on shipwrecks revealing the map or other ships.
