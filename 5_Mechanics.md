# Mechanics

## Movement

Movement is point and click style.
Abilities can include teleporting.

## Objects

Objects are either hardcoded or randomly generated.
Wearables such as armors and weapons are craftable. 
Weapons are made out of a base + mods. Allowing for the same weapon type to have different abilities.

### Tech

Objects (mostly wearables) have "slots" that can be filled by "infusion objects".
Slots can be filled by special objects that add active/passive effects, skills or can be combined with other infusable effects.
The slot - infusion object binding can be permanent or non-permanent.

Non-Permanent bindings can be removed and re-structured.
Permanent bindings have the chance of generating much stronger results - but it has a random element.

Infusables can have boni aswell as mali.
Example: Magic Infusable increases your magic, magic-atk and magic-def. But lowers your health and standard-defense.

Infusables can gain XP when used and level up to create stronger combinations aswell as adding a grinding element.

### Infusables

- Magic (increases magic, lowers health)
- Elemntal Effect (Fire, Ice,..) - Adds elem. effect on weapon. Adds absorb / protection on armor.
- Status Effect (Poison, Confusion,..)

## Actions

Abilities are activated using keyboard keys + clicking.

## Crafting

A crafting station allows to break an item into basic components or assemble one from them.
Crafting consumes energy and has random elements, so players have the possibility to consume any abountant resource to obtain a better version of the craft.

## Talking

Talking to online players can be done through voice or chat or quick voice commands.
Talking to offline players can be done by right clicking their avatar and selecting "message", or by referring to them in chat.
Offline players will receive the message on their companion app.

## Combat

Combat is a real time group engagement.
It can be either offensive during exploration, or defensive if the Cargo is under attack.
Player characters have defensive and offensive capabilities based on their class, stats, and equipment. Some are passive, some are active. The combat mechanism should really look like any point and click combat such as LoL.

### Defense

During Phase 2, bandits and scavengers can attack the Cargo to steal resources. Players must try and defend the ship.
For that, some players can stay at the ship during the phase. Players also have the ability to set up traps and automatic defense systems.

### Offense

During ship exploration, the team may encounter survivors. Most of them can be hostile.
